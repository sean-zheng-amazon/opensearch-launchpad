# Onboarding

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+** and `uv` installed ([Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
2. **Docker** installed and running ([Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
3. **For Phase 5 (AWS deployment)**: AWS credentials configured

## AWS Setup (for Phase 5 deployment)

Phase 5 (AWS deployment) is optional. Only complete this setup if you want to deploy to AWS OpenSearch.

### Step 1: Add AWS MCP Servers

Before starting Phase 5, add the required MCP servers to your power configuration:

1. Open the power's `mcp.json` file (located in the power directory)
2. Add the following servers to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch-orchestrator": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opensearch-orchestrator@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "aws-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "opensearch-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opensearch-mcp-server-py@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the file and restart Kiro or reconnect the MCP servers

### Step 2: Install AWS CLI

Install AWS CLI if not already installed:

```bash
# macOS
brew install awscli

# Linux
pip install awscli

# Windows
# Download from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
```

### Step 3: Configure AWS Credentials

Choose one method:

**Option A: AWS CLI configuration** (recommended):
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Enter your default region (e.g., us-east-1)
# Enter default output format (json)
```

**Option B: Environment variables**:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Verify AWS credentials:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Step 5: Ensure IAM Permissions

Your AWS user/role needs permissions for:
- OpenSearch Service: Create/manage domains and serverless collections
- IAM: Create and manage roles for OpenSearch
- Bedrock: Invoke models (for semantic search and agentic search)

Once configured, the AWS MCP servers will be available for Phase 5 deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### If you get a `spawn uvx ENOENT` error or If Docker is running but the MCP server can't find it

Some MCP clients may be unable to find `uvx` or `docker` from the JSON config
environment. This will result in error messages like
`Could not connect to MCP server dbt-mcp`, `Error: spawn uvx ENOENT`, or Docker
not found errors even when Docker is installed and running.

Solution: Locate the full path to `uvx` and `docker`, then ensure your MCP
`env.PATH` includes that directory:

macOS/Linux:
- Run `which uvx`
- Run `which docker` (example output: `/usr/local/bin/docker`)

Windows:
- Run `where uvx`
- Run `where docker`

If `which docker` returns `/usr/local/bin/docker`, add `/usr/local/bin` to
`env.PATH` in your MCP config.

1. Open the Command Palette in Kiro (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux), then run `Kiro: Open user MCP config (JSON)` (or open workspace MCP config).
2. In `mcpServers`, find the namespaced server entry (for example, `power-kiro-power-opensearch-orchestrator`) and update it to match the example below:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch-orchestrator": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "opensearch-orchestrator@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/anaconda3/bin"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save. Kiro applies changes on save and reconnects automatically (or reconnect from the MCP panel if needed).
4. If the connection still fails, open the MCP Server view and retry manually:
   - Go to `View` -> `Open View`
   - Type `MCP Servers`
   - Open the MCP Server view
   - Retry connect to `power-kiro-power-opensearch-orchestrator`


## Quick Test

After configuration, try: *"I want to build a semantic search app with 10M docs"*

# Overview

An MCP-powered assistant that guides you from requirements to a running OpenSearch search setup.

This power provides an OpenSearch Search Solution building workflow. It collects a sample document, gathers your preferences (budget, performance, query pattern), plans an architecture using an AI planner agent, and executes the plan to create indices, models, pipelines, and a search UI.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Collect Sample Document (mandatory first step)
- Ask the user how they want to provide a sample document. Present as a numbered list:
  1. Use built-in IMDB dataset
  2. Load from a local file or URL
  3. Load from a localhost OpenSearch index
  4. Paste JSON directly
- Based on the user choice, call `load_sample(source_type, source_value, localhost_auth_mode, localhost_auth_username, localhost_auth_password)`.
  - source_type: `builtin_imdb`, `local_file`, `url`, `localhost_index`, or `paste`
  - source_value: file path, URL, index name, or pasted JSON content (empty string for builtin_imdb)
  - localhost auth args are used only for `source_type="localhost_index"`:
    - `localhost_auth_mode`: `default`, `none`, or `custom` (`default` is internal fallback; do not present it as a user-facing choice)
    - `localhost_auth_username` and `localhost_auth_password`: required only for `custom`
    - mode behavior:
      - `none` => force no authentication
      - `custom` => force provided username/password
      - `default` => force `admin` / `myStrongPassword123!` (internal-only fallback)
- For option 2, determine whether the user provided a local file path or a URL and use the appropriate source_type (`local_file` or `url`).
- For option 3 (localhost index):
  - Ask auth mode first only when needed with these user-facing choices: `none` (no-auth) or `custom` (username/password). Do not present `default` as a user-facing choice.
  - If the user does not explicitly request `none` or `custom`, set `localhost_auth_mode="default"` internally.
  - If auth mode is `custom`, ask for username and password first (before asking for index name). If already provided, do not ask again.
  - After auth details are ready (or immediately for `none`/`default`), call `load_sample("localhost_index", "", <mode>, <username>, <password>)` first to fetch available non-system indices.
  - Present the returned indices as a numbered list and ask the user to pick one (by number or exact name). Then call `load_sample("localhost_index", <selected_index>, <mode>, <username>, <password>)`.
  - If the user already supplied a candidate index name, still validate it against the returned index list and ask for re-selection if it does not exist.
  - If the user already provided both username and password, do not ask for credentials again.
  - If the selected index is empty (has no documents), explain the issue and offer alternatives: ingest at least one document and retry, provide a local file/URL (option 2), use built-in IMDB (option 1), or paste JSON (option 4).
- For option 4, ask the user to paste 1-3 representative JSON records, then call `load_sample("paste", <pasted_content>)`.
- The result includes `inferred_text_fields` and `text_search_required`. Use these to skip redundant questions in Phase 2.
- A sample document is required before any planning or execution.

### Phase 2: Gather Preferences
- Ask one preference question at a time, in this order.
- Present each question as a numbered list and ask the user to reply with the number of their choice.

- If `text_search_required=true`:
  **Query pattern:**
  1. Mostly-exact (e.g. "Carmencita 1894")
  2. Mostly-semantic (e.g. "early silent films about dancers")
  3. Balanced (mix of both)

  **Performance priority:**
  1. Speed-first
  2. Balanced
  3. Accuracy-first

  **Budget:**
  1. Flexible
  2. Cost-sensitive

- If `text_search_required=true` and query pattern is balanced or mostly-semantic, ask deployment preference as a separate follow-up question:

  **Deployment preference:**
  1. OpenSearch node
  2. SageMaker endpoint
  3. External embedding API

- If `text_search_required=false`, skip query-pattern and deployment-preference questions.
  Keep the solution numeric/filter/aggregation-first, and do not suggest changing or enriching
  data purely to force semantic search unless the user explicitly requests semantic search.
- Call `set_preferences(budget, performance, query_pattern, deployment_preference)`.

### Phase 3: Plan
- Call `start_planning()` to get the initial architecture proposal.
- If `start_planning()` returns `manual_planning_required=true`, follow the returned planner bootstrap payload and call `set_plan_from_planning_complete(planner_response)` after user confirmation.
- Present the proposal to the user.
- If the user has feedback or questions, call `refine_plan(user_feedback)`. Repeat as needed.
- When the user confirms:
  - tool-driven path: call `finalize_plan()` and use {solution, search_capabilities, keynote}
  - manual path: call `set_plan_from_planning_complete(planner_response)` with the finalized planner output

### Phase 4: Execute
- Call `execute_plan()` to run index/model/pipeline/UI setup.
- If `execute_plan()` returns manual execution bootstrap payload, follow it and then call `set_execution_from_execution_report(worker_response, execution_context)` to persist normalized execution state.
- If execution fails, the user can fix the issue (e.g., restart Docker) and call `retry_execution()`.

### Phase 5: Deploy to AWS OpenSearch (optional)
- After successful local execution, offer to deploy the search strategy to AWS OpenSearch.
- **Important**: Before starting Phase 5, guide the user to add AWS MCP servers to the power's mcp.json configuration (see AWS Setup in Onboarding section). Verify the servers are configured before proceeding.
- Choose deployment target based on search strategy:
  - **OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS)**: For Neural Sparse, Dense Vector, BM25, and Hybrid search
  - **OpenSearch Domain (AOS)**: Required for Agentic Search; also supports all other strategies
- Use AWS API MCP tools (from the aws-api-mcp-server) to provision resources.
- Use OpenSearch MCP tools (from opensearch-mcp-server) to interact with the deployed cluster.
- Follow the appropriate AWS deployment steering file:
  - `aws-opensearch-serverless.md` for AOSS deployment
  - `aws-opensearch-domain.md` for AOS deployment (Agentic Search)
- Migrate the local configuration (indices, models, pipelines) to AWS.
- Configure AWS-specific settings (IAM roles, security, network access).
- Provide the user with AWS endpoint URLs and access instructions.

### Post-Execution
- After successful execution completion, explicitly tell the user
  how to access the UI using the returned `ui_access` URLs.
- `cleanup()` removes test documents when the user explicitly asks.
- After Phase 5 AWS deployment, provide AWS endpoint URLs and configuration details.

## Rules
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask exactly ONE preference question per message. Do NOT batch multiple preference questions together. Wait for the user's answer before asking the next question.
- Never skip Phase 1. A sample document is mandatory before planning.
- Prefer planner tools for plan generation.
- If `manual_planning_required=true`, use the returned planner prompt/input and persist via `set_plan_from_planning_complete(...)`.
- Show the planner's proposal text to the user verbatim; do not summarize it away.
- For preference questions, ask one question per turn and use user-input UI fixed options. Accept either a number or free-text answer.
- Do not ask redundant clarification questions for items already inferred from the sample data.
- Phase 5 (AWS deployment) is optional and should only be offered after successful Phase 4 execution.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+, uv, and Docker are required for Phases 1-4 (local development)
- AWS credentials and MCP servers are required for Phase 5 (AWS deployment) - see AWS Setup section
- See the [Onboarding](#onboarding) section for detailed setup instructions
