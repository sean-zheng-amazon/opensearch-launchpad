# Onboarding

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11+** and `uv` installed ([Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
2. **Docker** installed and running ([Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
3. **For Phase 5 (AWS deployment)**: AWS credentials configured

## AWS Setup (for Phase 5 deployment)

Phase 5 (AWS deployment) is optional. Only complete this setup if you want to deploy to AWS OpenSearch.

### Step 1: Add AWS MCP Servers

Before starting Phase 5, add the required MCP servers to your power configuration:

1. Open the power's `mcp.json` file (located in the power directory)
2. Add the following servers to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch-launchpad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opensearch-launchpad@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "aws-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "opensearch-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opensearch-mcp-server-py@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the file and restart Kiro or reconnect the MCP servers

### Step 2: Install AWS CLI

Install AWS CLI if not already installed:

```bash
# macOS
brew install awscli

# Linux
pip install awscli

# Windows
# Download from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
```

### Step 3: Configure AWS Credentials

Choose one method:

**Option A: AWS CLI configuration** (recommended):
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Enter your default region (e.g., us-east-1)
# Enter default output format (json)
```

**Option B: Environment variables**:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Verify AWS credentials:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Step 5: Ensure IAM Permissions

Your AWS user/role needs permissions for:
- OpenSearch Service: Create/manage domains and serverless collections
- IAM: Create and manage roles for OpenSearch
- Bedrock: Invoke models (for semantic search and agentic search)

Once configured, the AWS MCP servers will be available for Phase 5 deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### If you get a `spawn uvx ENOENT` error or If Docker is running but the MCP server can't find it

Some MCP clients may be unable to find `uvx` or `docker` from the JSON config
environment. This will result in error messages like
`Could not connect to MCP server dbt-mcp`, `Error: spawn uvx ENOENT`, or Docker
not found errors even when Docker is installed and running.

Solution: Locate the full path to `uvx` and `docker`, then ensure your MCP
`env.PATH` includes that directory:

macOS/Linux:
- Run `which uvx`
- Run `which docker` (example output: `/usr/local/bin/docker`)

Windows:
- Run `where uvx`
- Run `where docker`

If `which docker` returns `/usr/local/bin/docker`, add `/usr/local/bin` to
`env.PATH` in your MCP config.

1. Open the Command Palette in Kiro (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux), then run `Kiro: Open user MCP config (JSON)` (or open workspace MCP config).
2. In `mcpServers`, find the namespaced server entry (for example, `power-kiro-power-opensearch-launchpad`) and update it to match the example below:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch-launchpad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "opensearch-launchpad@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "PATH": "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/anaconda3/bin"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save. Kiro applies changes on save and reconnects automatically (or reconnect from the MCP panel if needed).
4. If the connection still fails, open the MCP Server view and retry manually:
   - Go to `View` -> `Open View`
   - Type `MCP Servers`
   - Open the MCP Server view
   - Retry connect to `power-kiro-power-opensearch-launchpad`


## Quick Test

After configuration, try: *"I want to build a semantic search app with 10M docs"*

# Overview

An MCP-powered assistant that guides you from requirements to a running OpenSearch search setup.

This power provides an OpenSearch Search Solution building workflow. It collects a sample document, gathers your preferences (budget, performance, query pattern), plans an architecture using an AI planner agent, and executes the plan to create indices, models, pipelines, and a search UI.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Collect Sample Document (mandatory first step)
- Ask the user how they want to provide a sample document. Present as a numbered list:
  1. Use built-in IMDB dataset
  2. Load from a local file or URL
  3. Load from a localhost OpenSearch index
  4. Paste JSON directly
- Based on the user choice, call `load_sample(source_type, source_value, localhost_auth_mode, localhost_auth_username, localhost_auth_password)`.
  - source_type: `builtin_imdb`, `local_file`, `url`, `localhost_index`, or `paste`
  - source_value: file path, URL, index name, or pasted JSON content (empty string for builtin_imdb)
  - localhost auth args are used only for `source_type="localhost_index"`:
    - `localhost_auth_mode`: `default`, `none`, or `custom` (`default` is internal fallback; do not present it as a user-facing choice)
    - `localhost_auth_username` and `localhost_auth_password`: required only for `custom`
    - mode behavior:
      - `none` => force no authentication
      - `custom` => force provided username/password
      - `default` => force `admin` / `myStrongPassword123!` (internal-only fallback)
- For option 2, determine whether the user provided a local file path or a URL and use the appropriate source_type (`local_file` or `url`). If the file type is not text based, e.g. pdf or docx, use docling to extract document data first. If docling is not installed, install it first.
- For option 3 (localhost index):
  - Ask auth mode first only when needed with these user-facing choices: `none` (no-auth) or `custom` (username/password). Do not present `default` as a user-facing choice.
  - If the user does not explicitly request `none` or `custom`, set `localhost_auth_mode="default"` internally.
  - If auth mode is `custom`, ask for username and password first (before asking for index name). If already provided, do not ask again.
  - After auth details are ready (or immediately for `none`/`default`), call `load_sample("localhost_index", "", <mode>, <username>, <password>)` first to fetch available non-system indices.
  - Present the returned indices as a numbered list and ask the user to pick one (by number or exact name). Then call `load_sample("localhost_index", <selected_index>, <mode>, <username>, <password>)`.
  - If the user already supplied a candidate index name, still validate it against the returned index list and ask for re-selection if it does not exist.
  - If the user already provided both username and password, do not ask for credentials again.
  - If the selected index is empty (has no documents), explain the issue and offer alternatives: ingest at least one document and retry, provide a local file/URL (option 2), use built-in IMDB (option 1), or paste JSON (option 4).
- For option 4, ask the user to paste 1-3 representative JSON records, then call `load_sample("paste", <pasted_content>)`.
- The result includes `inferred_text_fields` and `text_search_required`. Use these to skip redundant questions in Phase 2.
- A sample document is required before any planning or execution.

### Phase 2: Gather Preferences
- Ask one preference question at a time, in this order.
- Present each question as a numbered list and ask the user to reply with the number of their choice.

- If `text_search_required=true`:
  **Query pattern:**
  1. Mostly-exact (e.g. "Carmencita 1894")
  2. Mostly-semantic (e.g. "early silent films about dancers")
  3. Balanced (mix of both)

  **Performance priority:**
  1. Speed-first
  2. Balanced
  3. Accuracy-first

  **Budget:**
  1. Flexible
  2. Cost-sensitive

- If `text_search_required=true` and query pattern is balanced or mostly-semantic, ask deployment preference as a separate follow-up question:

  **Deployment preference:**
  1. OpenSearch node
  2. SageMaker endpoint
  3. External embedding API

- If `text_search_required=false`, skip query-pattern and deployment-preference questions.
  Keep the solution numeric/filter/aggregation-first, and do not suggest changing or enriching
  data purely to force semantic search unless the user explicitly requests semantic search.
- Call `set_preferences(budget, performance, query_pattern, deployment_preference)`.

### Phase 3: Plan
- Call `start_planning()` to get the initial architecture proposal.
- If `start_planning()` returns `manual_planning_required=true`, follow the returned planner bootstrap payload and call `set_plan_from_planning_complete(planner_response)` after user confirmation.
- Present the proposal to the user.
- If the user has feedback or questions, call `refine_plan(user_feedback)`. Repeat as needed.
- When the user confirms:
  - tool-driven path: call `finalize_plan()` and use {solution, search_capabilities, keynote}
  - manual path: call `set_plan_from_planning_complete(planner_response)` with the finalized planner output

### Phase 4: Execute
- Call `execute_plan()` to run index/model/pipeline/UI setup.
- If `execute_plan()` returns manual execution bootstrap payload, follow it and then call `set_execution_from_execution_report(worker_response, execution_context)` to persist normalized execution state.
- If execution fails, the user can fix the issue (e.g., restart Docker) and call `retry_execution()`.

### Phase 4.5: Evaluate Search Quality (optional)
- After successful Phase 4 execution, offer to evaluate search quality before deploying to AWS.
- Ask the user: *"Would you like to evaluate the search quality? I can analyze relevance, coverage, and capability gaps, and suggest improvements."*
- If the user agrees, call `start_evaluation()`.
- `start_evaluation()` executes verification queries against the live OpenSearch index (no client sampling needed) and returns the results.
- The response includes `evaluation_result_table` — a markdown table with ACTUAL search results from the live index. Each row has: `#`, `query_text`, `capability`, `doc_id`, `doc_details` (embeddings stripped), `score` (real BM25/vector score), and `relevance` (set to `?` awaiting judgment). **This is real data from the index — do NOT fabricate results or call other search tools.**
- When `manual_evaluation_required=true` (expected in Kiro powers):
  1. **Do NOT display the raw table yet.** Do NOT call `search_opensearch_org` or any other tool to get search results — the results are already in `evaluation_result_table`.
  2. **Act as both relevance judge and evaluator in a single pass**: Read each row in `evaluation_result_table`. For each hit, judge whether the document is relevant to the query intent based on the `doc_details` and `score`. Then produce a complete `<evaluation_complete>` block using the `evaluation_prompt`. Ground your dimension scores in the actual per-query data (e.g., count relevant hits out of top-5 for P@5, check if the first hit is relevant for MRR).
  3. Call `set_evaluation_from_evaluation_complete(evaluator_response)` with your `<evaluation_complete>` output.
- **Now render everything together** to the user in a single response:
  - Re-render the `evaluation_result_table` as a markdown table but with the `?` replaced by your actual relevance judgments (`relevant` or `irrelevant`). Include ALL rows from the original table — do not skip any queries or docs.
  - Below the table, show the evaluation summary: dimension scores, `search_quality_summary`, `issues`, and `suggested_preferences`.
- Doc details in the table have embeddings automatically stripped (fields containing `embedding` or `vector` are removed).
- If `suggested_preferences` is non-empty, offer to start over with the new preferences:
  *"Based on the evaluation, I suggest restarting with updated preferences to improve search quality. Would you like to try again?"*
- If the user agrees to restart, go back to Phase 1 (`load_sample`) and apply the suggested preferences automatically in Phase 2.
- If the user declines evaluation or declines to restart, proceed to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Deploy to AWS OpenSearch (optional)
- After successful local execution, offer to deploy the search strategy to AWS OpenSearch.
- **Important**: Before starting Phase 5, guide the user to add AWS MCP servers to the power's mcp.json configuration (see AWS Setup in Onboarding section). Verify the servers are configured before proceeding.
- Call `prepare_aws_deployment()` to get the deployment context. This returns:
  - `deployment_target`: "serverless" or "domain" (determined automatically from search strategy)
  - `search_strategy`: the detected strategy (bm25, neural_sparse, dense_vector, hybrid, agentic)
  - `steering_files`: ordered list of steering files to follow
  - `local_config`: extracted configuration from local setup (text fields, sample doc, preferences)
  - `required_mcp_servers`: MCP servers that must be connected
  - `state_file_template`: JSON template for `.opensearch-deploy-state.json`
- Write the `state_file_template` to `.opensearch-deploy-state.json` in the project root.
- Verify all `required_mcp_servers` are connected before proceeding.
- Follow each steering file from `steering_files` in order:
  - **Serverless track**: `serverless-01-provision.md` → `serverless-02-deploy-search.md`
  - **Domain track**: `domain-01-provision.md` → `domain-02-deploy-search.md` → `domain-03-agentic-setup.md` (agentic only)
- Between each steering file, read `.opensearch-deploy-state.json` for accumulated state (ARNs, IDs, endpoints).
- After each major step, update `.opensearch-deploy-state.json` with new values as instructed by the steering file.
- For cost, security, or HA questions, refer to `aws-reference.md`.
- Provide the user with AWS endpoint URLs and access instructions.

### Post-Execution
- After successful execution completion, explicitly tell the user
  how to access the UI using the returned `ui_access` URLs.
- `cleanup()` removes test documents when the user explicitly asks.
- After Phase 5 AWS deployment, provide AWS endpoint URLs and configuration details.
- After Phase 5, call `connect_search_ui_to_endpoint(endpoint, port, use_ssl, username, password, index_name)` to switch the Search UI to the AWS endpoint so the user can test searches against the cloud deployment directly from the same UI. The UI header badge will update to show "AWS Cloud" with a green connection dot.

## Rules
- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ask exactly ONE preference question per message. Do NOT batch multiple preference questions together. Wait for the user's answer before asking the next question.
- Never skip Phase 1. A sample document is mandatory before planning.
- Prefer planner tools for plan generation.
- If `manual_planning_required=true`, use the returned planner prompt/input and persist via `set_plan_from_planning_complete(...)`.
- Show the planner's proposal text to the user verbatim; do not summarize it away.
- For preference questions, ask one question per turn and use user-input UI fixed options. Accept either a number or free-text answer.
- Do not ask redundant clarification questions for items already inferred from the sample data.
- Phase 4.5 (evaluation) is optional and should only be offered after successful Phase 4 execution. Always proactively mention it is available.
- If evaluation suggests new preferences, offer to restart from Phase 1 with those preferences pre-applied.
- Phase 5 (AWS deployment) is optional and should only be offered after successful Phase 4 execution.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+, uv, and Docker are required for Phases 1-4 (local development)
- AWS credentials and MCP servers are required for Phase 5 (AWS deployment) - see AWS Setup section
- See the [Onboarding](#onboarding) section for detailed setup instructions

## Licenses

This power integrates with the following MCP servers:

- **opensearch-launchpad** (Apache-2.0 license) — core MCP server for the local workflow (Phases 1–4)
- **awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server** (Apache-2.0 license) — optional, used in Phase 5 for AWS API operations
- **awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server** (Apache-2.0 license) — optional, used in Phase 5 for AWS documentation lookups
- **opensearch-mcp-server-py** (Apache-2.0 license) — optional, used in Phase 5 for direct OpenSearch cluster operations

Steering files included in this power are original content licensed under Apache-2.0.

## Telemetry

This power does not collect, transmit, or store any client-side telemetry, analytics, or usage data. No data is sent to external services by the power itself.

## Privacy

- Session state (sample documents, preferences, auth mode) is persisted locally to `~/.opensearch_orchestrator/mcp_state.json` for session continuity across MCP reconnects. This file stays on your machine and is never transmitted externally. Passwords are not persisted to this file.
- When using the `search_opensearch_org` tool, queries are sent to DuckDuckGo to search opensearch.org documentation.
- When using `source_type="url"` in `load_sample`, the provided URL is fetched directly. No URLs are logged or stored beyond the local session state.
